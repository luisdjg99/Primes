# Primes Calculator

This is a java program to calculate how many primes exist from 1 to 100 000 000 , using 8 threads. This can be used as an introduction to the advantages of multiprocessing, as doing the same task using 1 thread will take up hours, while in this case is done within seconds. It's important to notice that it fails when n is larger than 100 000 000 

### Commands to run from terminal:
  
  - javac Primes.java  
  - java Primes
